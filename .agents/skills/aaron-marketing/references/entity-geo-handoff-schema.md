# Entity ↔ GEO Handoff Schema

Formalizes the data contract between `entity-optimizer` (writes canonical entity profiles) and `geo-content-optimizer` (reads entity facts to produce AI-citable content).

## Canonical entity profile location

`memory/entities/<slug>.md` — one file per canonical entity. Slug uses kebab-case (`acme-analytics`, `jane-doe-founder`, `acme-corp-2026`).

## Profile frontmatter (authoritative — entity-optimizer is sole writer)

```yaml

### Field descriptions

| Field | Type | Required | Consumed by |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | slug string | Yes | all |
| `display_name` | string | Yes | geo-content-optimizer (as entity display) |
| `type` | enum | Yes | serp-markup-builder (picks Schema.org type), geo-content-optimizer |
| `primary_domain` | URL | Yes | geo-content-optimizer (first-party citation) |
| `also_known_as[]` | strings | Recommended | geo-content-optimizer (alias coverage for AI disambiguation) |
| `same_as[]` | URLs | Recommended | serp-markup-builder (`sameAs` property), geo-content-optimizer |
| `wikidata_q` | QID or null | Optional | geo-content-optimizer (as authoritative signal) |
| `description_short` | string ≤160 chars | Yes | serp-markup-builder (fallback meta desc), geo-content-optimizer (first-paragraph boilerplate) |
| `description_long` | markdown paragraph | Yes | geo-content-optimizer (about-page source of truth) |
| `ai_resolution_status` | per-engine enum | Yes | geo-content-optimizer (decides which engines need targeting; its [AI-overview-recovery playbook](../seo-geo/build/geo-content-optimizer/references/ai-overview-recovery.md) scopes rewrite effort) |
| `ai_resolution_notes[]` | strings | Recommended | geo-content-optimizer (what disambiguation to add in body) |
| `gap_type` | enum or null | Yes | next-best-skill routing for downstream |
| `next_action` | string or null | Yes | Open loop if non-null |

## Contract rules

### Writes (entity-optimizer — sole writer)

1. One file per canonical entity. Never split across files.
2. Updates to any field bump `last_verified` to today.
3. AI resolution test MUST run at least quarterly; update `ai_resolution_status` per engine.
4. If `gap_type != null`, also append a one-line entry to `memory/open-loops.md`.
5. Never write `memory/entities/<slug>.md` for a candidate entity. Candidates go to `memory/entities/candidates.md` only.

### Reads (geo-content-optimizer — primary consumer)

1. BEFORE writing content that mentions a brand, person, product, or org, check if a canonical profile exists at `memory/entities/<slug>.md`.
2. If the profile exists:
   - Use `display_name` for all first mentions.
   - Use `description_short` for meta description fallback if page-specific isn't provided.
   - Use `ai_resolution_status` to decide whether disambiguation boilerplate is needed (add it if ANY engine is `unrecognized` or `confused`).
   - Use `also_known_as` and `ai_resolution_notes` to add alias-coverage sentences in body.
3. If the profile is missing OR `last_verified` is > 90 days stale:
   - Set Status = `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`
   - Add `open_loop`: "Entity <display_name> needs re-verification — profile not updated since <date>. Recommend running entity-optimizer."
4. If `ai_resolution_status` shows the target engine as `unrecognized`, emit a recommendation handoff to entity-optimizer BEFORE publishing content on that query.

### Reads (serp-markup-builder — secondary consumer)

1. When generating `Organization` / `Product` / `Person` schema, look up `memory/entities/<slug>.md` first.
2. Populate `name`, `sameAs`, `logo`, `founder`, `foundingDate`, `url`, `address` from the profile. No guessing.
3. If profile missing, ask user to confirm fields before embedding in JSON-LD.

## Versioning

- Profile format version: **1.0** (2026-04)
- Future additions MUST preserve backward compatibility:
  - New optional fields OK
  - Removing a field requires a major version bump
  - Changing a field's type (string → list) requires a major version bump
